# üè¨ Retail Store Microservice Platform

A **cloud-native, microservices-driven retail platform** built with **Java (Spring Boot)**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AI-powered Recommendation Engine**.  
This system demonstrates **real-world enterprise architecture** with modular services, centralized configuration, service discovery, API gateway, and fault-tolerant design.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Customer-friendly shopping experience** with Cart, Order, and Payment microservices.  
- **Product & Inventory management** for real-time stock updates.  
- **AI Recommendation Engine** for personalized product suggestions.  
- **Microservice-based modular design** enabling independent scaling & deployment.  
- **Cloud-ready architecture** with Kubernetes orchestration.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot (REST APIs, JPA/Hibernate)  
- **Frontend (optional):** React.js / Vue.js  
- **Database:** MySQL (Product, Inventory, Order, Payment), Redis (Caching), MongoDB (Recommendation Engine)  
- **AI/ML:** Recommendation engine using collaborative filtering & content-based models  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Cloud (Config, Eureka, Gateway), CI/CD pipeline

## üß© Microservices
1. **Product Service** ‚Äì manages product catalog (CRUD, categories, search).  
2. **Inventory Service** ‚Äì manages stock availability in real-time.  
3. **Cart Service** ‚Äì handles customer shopping cart operations.  
4. **Order Service** ‚Äì processes orders, communicates with Payment & Inventory.  
5. **Payment Service** ‚Äì integrates with payment gateways, ensures secure transactions.  
6. **AI Recommendation Service** ‚Äì provides personalized product recommendations using ML models.
